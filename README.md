# angularjs_task_manager
Recreation of a Task Manager design made by Aga Ciurysek

Inspiration: https://dribbble.com/shots/4184957-Task-Manager

Todos:

AngularJS 
1) add ng-click listener to the "Add Task" button that adds another task to the top of the tasklist
2) Swap out the contents of the "task details" view based on the task you clicked on the task list\
3) make the attachment button work 
4) Make the submit comment button work, it should add a comment to the current selected task in the task details view
5) Make the search bar on top filter the list of tasks 
6) Create a dropdown box when the chevron next to "MARKETING" is clicked 


Layout/CSS:  
1) Seperate branch to implement mobile view of the dashboard using CSS grid (it's currently non responsive and only for desktop)
2) The search and comment input boxes dont let you type to full width of the div
3) The check mark picture on the left of each task needs to be replaced with a font awesome icon
4) The ends of the progress bar on the left side should be rounded 
5) I think Roboto Font is fine but if anyone has a better idea for fonts that match the origional design better, let me know
